<div id="divContentExplanation">
    <p>The “People” table and the “Pictures” table refer to one another by sharing the column “Picture#”
        which is the picture id. Also, the “Locations” table and the “Pictures” table refer to on
        another by
        sharing the “Location” column. We can use the “Location” column in the “Pictures” table to find
        out
        where a picture was taken, by finding the matching location value in the “Location” column in
        the
        “Locations” table. Likewise, we can find out which people are in a picture by using the
        “Picture#”
        column in the “Picture” and “People” tables.
